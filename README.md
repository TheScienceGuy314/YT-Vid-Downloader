# YT-Vid-Downloader
YT-Vid-Downloader is a free and open-source application made by me to allow you to download videos.

You can download the application here:

The application doesn't require Python to run, and doesn't need further installation after download.

Yes, YouTube misspelling as YubTub is intentional.

Only for Windows currently.

Alternatively, you can download Python and run the source file (YouTube_Video_Downloader.pyw).
